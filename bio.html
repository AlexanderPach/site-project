            Hello my name is Alexander Pacheco. I'm currently finishing my associates degree in Computer Science. Before I dedicated my life to 
            coding full time. I played college wrestling and college football for my first year of college. Unfortunately life has a way of telling me
            my journey. This led to a path of Python/Java. Which allowed me to eventually come across Multiverse.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            With my new future relying on the material I will be learning throughout this year will allow me to grow to become the person who I wanted to be.
            Even if web development isn't my forte, I sure hope to put my career towards career paths the involve more technical aspects of the industry.
        </p>
